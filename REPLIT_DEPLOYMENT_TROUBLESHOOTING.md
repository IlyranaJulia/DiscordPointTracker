# Replit Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Application runs successfully locally on port 5000
- ✅ All health check endpoints (/, /health, /healthz) return HTTP 200
- ✅ Flask server configured to use PORT environment variable for Cloud Run
- ✅ Bot successfully connects to Discord and syncs 7 slash commands
- ❓ Replit deployment URL not accessible

## Common Deployment Issues and Solutions

### 1. Environment Variables Not Set in Deployment
**Problem**: BOT_TOKEN might not be configured in the deployment environment.

**Solution**: 
1. Go to your Replit project settings
2. Click on "Secrets" tab
3. Add your BOT_TOKEN secret with the actual Discord bot token value
4. Redeploy the application

### 2. Port Configuration Issues
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Flask server now uses `PORT` environment variable

### 3. Health Check Endpoints
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - All endpoints return 200:
- `/` - Returns HTML dashboard with 200 status
- `/health` - Returns JSON health status
- `/healthz` - Returns JSON health status for Kubernetes compatibility

### 4. Deployment Target Configuration
Current `.replit` configuration:
```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
run = ["sh", "-c", "python main.py"]
```

## Next Steps to Try

### Step 1: Check Replit Deployment Logs
1. In your Replit project, look for deployment logs
2. Check if there are any error messages during deployment
3. Look for port binding or environment variable errors

### Step 2: Verify Bot Token in Secrets
1. Ensure `BOT_TOKEN` is properly set in Replit Secrets
2. Make sure the token is valid and not expired
3. Verify the token has correct permissions

### Step 3: Manual Deployment Test
Try deploying with the deploy button in Replit:
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Check deployment logs for any errors

### Step 4: Alternative Port Binding Test
If needed, you can test with a specific port by setting in Replit Secrets:
- Key: `PORT`
- Value: `8080` (or another port if specified by Replit)

## Deployment Verification Commands

Once deployed, these endpoints should be accessible:
```
https://discord-point-tracker-ilyranajulia.replit.app/
https://discord-point-tracker-ilyranajulia.replit.app/health
https://discord-point-tracker-ilyranajulia.replit.app/healthz
```

All should return HTTP 200 status codes.

## Current Application Features
- ✅ 7 Discord slash commands working
- ✅ SQLite database with points management
- ✅ Web dashboard on root URL
- ✅ Admin panel at /dashboard
- ✅ Email submission system
- ✅ Complete health monitoring endpoints

## Support
If the deployment still doesn't work after trying these steps, the issue may be:
1. Replit-specific deployment configuration
2. Bot token permissions or validity
3. Discord API connectivity from the deployment environment

The application code is fully functional and deployment-ready based on all local testing.
