Why Your Bot Still Goes Offline (Even with UptimeRobot Ping)

You're using UptimeRobot to ping https://discord-point-tracker-ilyranajulia.replit.app every 5 minutes ‚Äî this does keep the Replit web server awake, but:

It does NOT guarantee that your Discord bot is running.
‚úÖ The Root Problem

UptimeRobot only sends HTTP requests (pings) to your Replit web server, usually a Flask app.

If your code does not also run bot.run(TOKEN) at the same time, your bot will appear offline in Discord, even though your .replit.app is "Up".

‚úÖ Correct Architecture for Replit Discord Bot with Flask Ping

Here‚Äôs the recommended structure to keep both Flask (for pinging) and your bot running:

from flask import Flask
import threading
import discord
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "I'm alive"

def run_flask():
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)

# Start Flask server in a separate thread
threading.Thread(target=run_flask).start()

# Now start the Discord bot
intents = discord.Intents.default()
bot = discord.Client(intents=intents)

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"Logged in as {bot.user}")

bot.run(os.getenv("BOT_TOKEN"))
üîß How to Confirm Your Bot Is Running

Check that your main.py or bot.py includes both:
run_flask() (to keep Replit awake via ping)
bot.run(TOKEN) (to connect to Discord)
Make sure bot.run() is not blocked by Flask
That‚Äôs why we run Flask in a new thread with threading.Thread(...)
Check your Replit console logs ‚Äî you should see:
Logged in as pipi-bot#6532
‚úÖ What to Do Now

Open your Replit file (likely main.py)
Confirm you are starting both Flask and your Discord bot as shown above
Click Run in Replit and check console output
Ensure your Discord token is set properly via Secrets
Key: BOT_TOKEN
Value: your actual Discord bot token
üìå Summary

Action	Result
Ping Flask site via UptimeRobot	‚úÖ Keeps Replit project alive
Forget to run bot.run()	‚ùå Bot appears offline
Flask blocks bot	‚ùå Bot never starts
Use threading to run Flask	‚úÖ Bot and Flask can run together
